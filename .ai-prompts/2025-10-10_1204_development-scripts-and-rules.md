## üîÑ Development Process Updates

**Checkboxes marked complete in `development_process.md`**:
- Phase 0.1: Initialize Flutter project with proper folder structure ‚úÖ

**Current Phase Progress**: 5% complete (1 of ~20 Phase 0 tasks)

---

## üí° Key Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Use `.ai-prompts/` folder for prompt logging
   - **Rationale**: Hidden folder keeps repo clean, follows convention for tool-specific directories
   - **Alternatives Considered**: `prompts/`, `docs/prompts/`, `.logs/`

2. **Decision**: Timestamp format `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM_description.md`
   - **Rationale**: ISO 8601 compatible, sortable, self-documenting, readable
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Unix timestamps (less readable), date-only (not unique)

3. **Decision**: Separate scripts for macOS and Windows
   - **Rationale**: Platform-specific features (simulator vs emulator), better UX
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Single cross-platform script (too complex)

4. **Decision**: Two script variants (simple + enhanced)
   - **Rationale**: Covers both quick daily use and advanced workflows
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Single complex script with many flags

5. **Decision**: Firebase as primary cloud provider
   - **Rationale**: User indicated preference in development_process.md edit
   - **Alternatives Considered**: AWS, GCP (kept as options in comments)

## üêõ Issues Encountered

- **Issue 1**: Original .cursorrules file was deleted by user
  - **Resolution**: User has existing dreamflowrules.md, rules were added there instead

- **Issue 2**: Windows doesn't have native iOS Simulator support
  - **Resolution**: Windows scripts focus on Android, documented limitation clearly

---

## üìå Notes & Follow-ups

**Important Notes**:
- Scripts are executable on macOS (chmod +x already run)
- Windows batch files don't need execute permissions
- iOS Simulator startup includes 60-second timeout protection
- Android emulator must be created beforehand (documented in prerequisites)

**Follow-up Actions Needed**:
- [ ] Test scripts on actual iOS Simulator
- [ ] Test scripts on Android Emulator
- [ ] Verify build_runner detection works correctly
- [ ] Update token costs when actual pricing is known
- [ ] Create CI/CD workflows (Phase 0.1)

**Related Sessions**:
- None (first session)

## üéì Learnings

**What Worked Well**:
- Comprehensive script documentation with troubleshooting
- Cross-platform support from the start
- Clear folder structure and naming conventions
- Visual output with color coding (macOS scripts)
- Template-based approach for consistency

**What Could Be Improved**:
- Could add more error recovery mechanisms
- Might benefit from config file for customization
- Could add dry-run mode for safety

**Prompting Tips for Future**:
- Breaking complex requests into stages worked well
- Providing existing files as context helped maintain consistency
- Asking for cross-platform support upfront saved rework
- Requesting documentation alongside code ensured completeness
