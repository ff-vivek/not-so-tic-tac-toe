# 🎉 Project Setup Complete!

## What's Been Created

Your **Gridlock X & O Evolved** project now has a complete development infrastructure!

---

## 📦 Development Scripts

### ✅ Created 4 Scripts (Cross-Platform)

#### macOS/Linux Scripts
1. **`run_app.sh`** - Simple iOS run script
   - Auto pulls code
   - Installs dependencies
   - Runs build_runner
   - Starts iOS Simulator automatically
   - Launches app with hot reload

2. **`dev.sh`** - Enhanced multi-platform script
   - Commands: `ios`, `android`, `setup`, `clean`
   - Full automation for both platforms
   - Smart simulator/emulator detection
   - Color-coded output

#### Windows Scripts
3. **`run_app.bat`** - Simple run script for Windows
   - Same workflow as shell script
   - Works with any connected device/emulator

4. **`dev.bat`** - Enhanced Windows script
   - Commands: `android`, `setup`, `clean`
   - Automated workflow for Android

**All scripts are executable and ready to use!**

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### First Time Use

#### On macOS
```bash
# Scripts are already executable!
# Run first-time setup
./dev.sh setup

# Then start developing
./dev.sh ios      # iOS development
./dev.sh android  # Android development
```

#### On Windows
```cmd
# Run first-time setup
dev.bat setup

# Then start developing (start emulator first)
dev.bat android
```

### Daily Workflow

#### macOS - Option 1 (Simple)
```bash
./run_app.sh
```
**Takes ~2 minutes** - Fully automated iOS development

#### macOS - Option 2 (Enhanced)
```bash
./dev.sh ios        # For iOS
./dev.sh android    # For Android
```

#### Windows
```cmd
run_app.bat         # Simple (device must be connected)
dev.bat android     # Enhanced (emulator must be running)
```

## 🎯 What Each Script Does

### `run_app.sh` (macOS) / `run_app.bat` (Windows)
**Best for**: Daily iOS development (macOS) or quick testing (Windows)

**Workflow**:
```
Git Pull → Dependencies → Build Runner → Start Simulator → Launch App
```

**Time**: ~2-3 minutes (fully automated on macOS)

---

### `dev.sh` (macOS) / `dev.bat` (Windows)
**Best for**: Multiple platforms, maintenance, first-time setup

**Commands Available**:

#### `./dev.sh ios` (macOS only)
Complete iOS development workflow with automation

#### `./dev.sh android` / `dev.bat android`
Complete Android development workflow
- macOS: Auto-starts emulator
- Windows: Requires emulator running

#### `./dev.sh setup` / `dev.bat setup`
First-time project setup:
- Installs dependencies
- Runs Flutter doctor
- Generates code
- Verifies everything is ready

#### `./dev.sh clean` / `dev.bat clean`
Nuclear option when things go wrong:
- Flutter clean
- Deletes all generated files
- Reinstalls dependencies
- Regenerates code

---

## 🎨 Script Features

### ✅ Automation
- Git pull on every run (always up-to-date)
- Automatic dependency installation
- Code generation (build_runner)
- Simulator/emulator startup (macOS)
- App launch with hot reload

### ✅ Safety
- Validation at each step
- Clear error messages
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Timeout protection

### ✅ User Experience
- Color-coded output (macOS)
- Progress indicators
- Estimated time remaining
- Clear success/failure messages

### ✅ Smart Detection
- Check if simulator/emulator already running
- Detect available devices
- Conditional build_runner execution
- Platform-specific optimizations

---

## 🛠️ Maintenance Commands

### When Things Go Wrong

#### Build Issues
```bash
./dev.sh clean      # macOS
dev.bat clean       # Windows
```

#### Simulator Won't Start (macOS)
```bash
# Check available simulators
xcrun simctl list devices

# Manually open simulator
open -a Simulator
```

#### Emulator Issues
```bash
# List available emulators
emulator -list-avds

# Start specific emulator (macOS/Linux)
emulator -avd <name> &

# Start specific emulator (Windows)
emulator -avd <name>
```

#### Update Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub upgrade
./dev.sh clean
```

---

## 📊 Time Savings

### Manual Workflow (Before)
```
1. git pull                                    (10s)
2. flutter pub get                             (20s)
3. flutter pub run build_runner build          (60s)
4. Open Simulator app                          (5s)
5. Wait for simulator to boot                  (30s)
6. Find simulator ID                           (10s)
7. flutter run -d <device-id>                  (30s)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total: ~3 minutes + manual overhead
```

### With Scripts (Now)
```
1. ./dev.sh ios                                (2-3 minutes, fully automated)
   └─ You can grab coffee while it runs! ☕
```

**Saved per run**: ~2-3 minutes of manual work
**Saved per week** (5 runs/day): ~50-75 minutes
**Saved per month**: ~3-5 hours

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Alias for Even Faster Development
Add to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
# Gridlock dev shortcuts
alias gridlock-ios="cd ~/Documents/dreamflow/not-so-tic-tac-toe && ./dev.sh ios"
alias gridlock-android="cd ~/Documents/dreamflow/not-so-tic-tac-toe && ./dev.sh android"
alias gridlock-clean="cd ~/Documents/dreamflow/not-so-tic-tac-toe && ./dev.sh clean"
```

Then just run:
```bash
gridlock-ios    # From anywhere!
```

### 2. Background Running
To run app in background (macOS):
```bash
./dev.sh ios &
```

### 3. Multiple Devices
To see all connected devices:
```bash
flutter devices
```

To run on specific device:
```bash
flutter run -d <device-id>
```
